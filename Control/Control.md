## SCHab One : Control

Given my background in IT, you shouldn't be surprised that I intend to trick out SCHab with some impressive monitoring and control gizmos.

### Monitoring
* Indoor air temperature
* Outdoor air temperature
* Battery voltage
* Solar / Wind current input
* Usage current
* Water temperature input to radiant heat circuits
* Water temperature return from each circuit
* Water pressure
* Water storage tank level
* Propane tank levels

### Control
* Radiant heat pumps
* Ventilation fan speed
* Lights
