## SCHab One : Requirements

Its generally a good idea to have in mind what you want, your requirements, before you go about designing and building it.  Here's what I have in mind for the requirements of SCHab One.

| General Requirements |
| ----- | ----- |
| No. | GEN01 |
| Title | SCHab shall be completely transportable in a single 40' HC Shipping Container. |
| Description | While some components of SCHab may be placed outside the container while in use, everything must be attached or contained within the container so it can be shipped as a single unit. |
| | |
| No. | GEN02 |
| Title | Other than service entries, SCHab shall not have penetrations in the shipping container skin. |
| Description | Entry will be at either end with the shipping container doors open.  Other than vents, water, sewer and electrical connections, there will be no other openings in the container (e.g. no doors or windows on the sides.) |
| | |
| No. | GEN03 |
| Title | SCHab shall require minimal site preparation. |
| Description | Other that the need to be level and room to open the doors, SChab shouldn't have any onerous site requirements. |
| | |
| No. | GEN04 |
| Title | SCHab shall provide suffcient sleeping space for 2 adults. |
| Description | In other words, a queen size bed. YMMV |

| Electrical Requirements |
| ----- | ----- |
| No. | ELEC01 |
| Title | Combined electrical generation and storage capacity shall meet 120% of expected average load over the course of habitation period. |
| Description | Some excess capacity is needed to support future growth.  At the same time it isn't necessary to provide capacity for those periods where the habitat is expected to be empty. |
| | |
| No. | ELEC02 |
| Title | Combined electrical generation and storage capacity shall meet 120% of the minimal sustaining load over the course of the non-habitation period. |
| Description | When we're not living in our SCHab, it will still have some electrical load requirements.  E.g. security and monitoring system, freeze protection, etc.
| | |

| Plumbing Requirements |
| ----- | ----- |
| No. | PLUM01 |
| Title | Water collection plus reserve supply shall meet 110% of the expected average usage during the habitation period. |
| Description | Compared to electric, water is a little easier to conserve so its requirement is a little lower. |
| | |
| No. | PLUM02 |
| Title | Black water and gray water shall be handled separately. |
| Description | While not all jurisdictions differentiate between black water and gray water, they can be handled differently.  For example, gray water can be recycled for irrigation.  I make sense to keep them separate. |

| Heating Requirements |
| ----- | ----- |
| No. | HEAT01 |
| Title | Heating generation capacity shall be sufficient to maintain a minimum of 65F during the coldest average conditions during the habitation period. |
| Description | This is complicated because it depends largely on the heat leakage of SCHab.  We'll take a stab at it. |
| | |
| No. | HEAT02 |
| Title | SCHab shall maintain HEAT01 for a period of 60 days without manual intervention. |
| Description | This deals with the size of the propane tanks.  I don't want to be having them refilled more frequently than this. |

| Ventilation Requirements |
| ----- | ----- |
| No. | VENT01 |
| Title | Ventilation shall be sufficient to keep indoor temperature within 5F of outside ambient temperature. |
| Description | I'm just pulling this one out of my rear.  I know that it is hard to keep a big, closed container cool with the sun beating down on it. Basically it needs enough ventilation to not become a sweat box on mild days. |

| Construction Requirements |
