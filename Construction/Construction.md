## SCHab One : Construction

### Tools

General carpentry tools should be sufficient for most of the construction.  Table saw, circular saw, nail gun, glue gun, etc.  Since the shipping container is steel, we'll also need some metal working tools.  Specifically we'll need to cut openings for vents on the roof and service entry on the side.  I plan to fabricate an elevated steel box for the vents and a recessed steel box for the service entry.  So you'll need an angle grinder with cutting wheels and a welder to weld the boxes to the shipping container.

### Construction Considerations

First, since SCHab is designed to be relocatable, we'll have to consider how transporting it can impact the structure.  Sliding on and off trailers, as well as bouncing along roads, is not something encountered by typical residential construction.  

Second, the steel of the shipping container will expand and contract as temperature varies much more than the wood framing inside.

Finally, shipping containers are not as strong as you might think.  Yes they are designed so they can be stacked 8 high but that's only because the corners and ends are strong.  The rest of the structure is just enough to keep the weather out.  If you've ever seen a front loader lift one at the corner (you can find examples on youtube.com), the container will twist and flex.

With these considerations in mind, I've made the following construction decisions:

* Only the floor of the framed interior is attached to the shipping container.  The walls and ceiling are free standing.

This way the shipping container can expand, contract and flex to a degree without impacting the interior framing.

* Interior walls and ceiling are sheathed with 1/16" plastic panels instead of sheetrock.

Sheetrock is heavy and I suspect after bouncing down the road it would crack at the attachment screws and the seams.  Also I've done enough sheetrock work in my life that I don't want to do any more.  Added bonus, no painting required.
