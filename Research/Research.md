## SCHab One : Research

Several subsystems of SCHab are complex topics in their own right.  Here I look for resources that have already done some of the heavy lifting.  Research topics include:
* Rainwater harvesting
* Gray water disposal
* Gray water recycling
* Solar power generation
* Wind power generation
* Radiant heat
* Purchasing shipping containers
* Transporting shipping containers
