## SCHab One : Research

Several subsystems of SCHab are complex topics in their own right.  Here I look for resources that have already done some of the heavy lifting.  Research topics include:

* [Rainwater Harvesting](#rainwaterharvesting)
* [Gray Water Disposal](#greywaterdisposal)
* [Gray Water Recycling](#greywaterrecycling)
* [Solar Power Generation](#solarpower)
* [Wind Power Generation](#windpower)
* [Radiant Heat](#radiantheat)
* [Purchasing Shipping Containers](#scpurchase)
* [Transporting Shipping Containers](#sctransport)

### Rainwater Harvesting<a name='rainwaterharvesting'></a>

First, I don't want to have a well drilled.  Depending on location this can be quite expensive.  A well also increases the electrical requirements.  I know that statistics show the average person takes some 25 - 50gal per day.  I also know, living in the RV, that I can made do with much less.  I don't have big water wasters like lawn watering, a flush toilet, or long showers.  So rainwater harvesting seems like a viable solution.

From my research so far, harvesting off a shipping container is problematic.  First, its flat.  The rainwater will run off all over the place.  Even if we could catch it, 40' x 8' isn't much of a collection area.  There are few places in the country where 320 sq ft of collection area will give you enough water.

There is also the question of storage.  I have designed in a 275 gal bladder tank in the crawl space.  That will help get through some dry months but it isn't a huge amount.

Generally rainwater harvesting is broken down into the following categories:

* Collection
* Storage
* Filtration
* Treatment

Collection is mainly focused on the surface area required to collect the amount of water you'll need given the average rainfall in your area of choice.  You'll get roughly 0.62 gal per sq ft per inch of rain.  My [RainHarvestingProjections.xlsx](Research\RainwaterHarvesting\RainHarvestingProjections.xlsx) spreadsheet shows some calculations for a couple locations.

Storage is needed to carry you through times when there is no rain.  So while collection area can be based on average annual rainfall, you'll need to look at monthly rainfall averages to determine storage requirements.  Let's say, for example, that a location gets 50in of rain per year.  You can design the collector to capture enough of that 50in to satisfy your needs.  But say that those 50in only come over a couple months in the spring.  Then you'll need a large storage capacity to keep you in water for the other 10 months.  On the other hand, if those 50in are spread evenly over the year, you'll need less storage.  Maybe only enough to carry you for a week or two.  The above spreadsheet takes that into consideration.

Filtration removes particulates from the water.  It is a multi-stage process that starts with screens at the gutters, a 'first flush' mechanism, particulates settling out in the storage tank, then two or three filters.

Treatment kills microorganisms that may be in the water.  I'm leaning toward a UV system since that seems easiest to install and maintain.

Most rainwater harvesting designs do things in this order:

collection -> storage -> filtration -> treatment

I've decided though that I don't want unfiltered or untreated water in my storage tank.  I don't want particulates settling out in my storage tank because I don't want to worry about periodically cleaning it out.  Instead I'm thinking of the following:

collection -> catch basin -> filtration -> treatment -> storage

The catch basin would be outside and sized to collect the water from an average rainfall.  A pump would move the water from there, through the filtration/treatment system and into storage. I haven't research this much so I don't have answers to these questions:

* How fast can I pump water through the filtration/treatment system?  If we have a deluge, can I pump it fast enough to keep the catch basin from overflowing?
* How do I keep all of this from freezing in the winter?
* How do I harvest snowfall if that becomes a consideration?

### Gray Water Disposal<a name='greywaterdisposal'></a>

Let's speak frankly.  Gray water is the waste water you generate than doesn't have poop.  Black water is waste water that does have poop.  Since I'm planning to use a waterless toilet, all of the waste water for SCHab will be gray water.  

Note: Some jurisdictions treat gray water the same as black water.  If you're in one of those areas, you'll need a septic system anyway.

You could just run the gray water onto the ground.  In the interest of full disclosure, the SCHab gray water will have pee.  (Urine is quite sterile but not everyone knows that.)  Having urine smell around your SCHab is probably not a good idea.  Right now I'm thinking of a [french drain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_drain) located some distance from the SCHab.  That may change if it looks like gray water recycling (e.g. garden irrigation) would be a good idea for me.

Note: You don't want to store gray water unless you plan to later dispose of it as black water.  The microbes in gray water will eventually turn it septic.

### Gray Water Recycling<a name='greywaterrecycling'></a>

If you're in a really arid region you may want to keep every drop of water you can.  Is it possible to pump your gray water back into your rainwater harvesting system and not make everyone sick?  I'm sure it's possible (they recycle water on the ISS) but it may not be practical.  

Irrigating a garden is an easy recycling plan. Just plumb the gray water drain pipe to irrigation pipes.  Maybe a diverter valve to a french drain to control the amount of water to the garden.

### Solar Power Generation<a name='solarpower'></a>

This one is easy for me.  We use solar power in our RV.  Renogy solar panels, Vmaxtank AGM batteries, and MPPT charge controller are my choice.  I am going to try Renogy's polycrystalline panels this time even though I have monocrystalline panels on the RV.  Polys are less expensive but less efficient than monos.  Poly panels need to be larger to get the same power output.  On my RV, with limited roof space, smaller panels are a good thing.  On SCHab it's less important so I'd rather have the lower cost.  The main question here is how many panels and batteries do I need for the electrical load.

### Wind Power Generation<a name='windpower'></a>

I've not used wind power but considering it due to my acute familiarity with the limitations of solar.  If you're in an area with long periods of cloudy skies you may need to dramatically increase the number of solar panels and batteries necessary to keep the lights on.  That isn't cheap.  Depending on location, it may make sense to supplement solar power generation with wind.  More research to come.

### Purchasing Shipping Containers<a name='scpurchase'></a>

SCHab will use a 40' HC DD shipping container. 40' because that's its length.  HC mean 'high cube' with means 9'6" tall instead of the usual 8'6" tall.  DD mean 'double-door', a door at both ends.  I won't go into all of the ins and outs of shipping containers, e.g. new vs one-trip vs used.  A [simple Internet search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=shipping+or+conex+containers) will take care of that (search for 'conex' as well as 'shipping container').  I do believe that the double-door variant is harder to find.  Also, you'll want to buy local to cut down on transportation costs.  I'll do more here when I get closer to buying a container.
